# Project: Minimal OS with Kubernetes Support

This document outlines the roadmap for the development of a custom operating system. It includes key components and features that will be implemented as part of the project.

## Project Description

- **Goal**: This project aims to develop a minimal operating system with the primary goal of supporting Kubernetes. The OS will not have a graphical user interface (GUI) and will focus solely on the necessary components to run Kubernetes effectively.

## Additional Notes

- This roadmap is a living document and may evolve as the project progresses.
- Security: Implement basic security features necessary for Kubernetes.
- Modularity: Focus on modularity in the OS design to ease future enhancements.
- Community Feedback: If open-source, seek community feedback and contributions.
